# Facebook Marketplace & Group Alert System

Tired of constantly checking Facebook Marketplace or private groups for something you need‚Äîespecially when it's free‚Äîonly to miss it because you weren‚Äôt fast enough?  
I was in the same boat, wasting time manually monitoring posts.

So, I built this lightweight alert system on my MacBook.

## üöÄ What It Does

This system automatically scans **Facebook Marketplace** and **private groups** (that you're a member of) for posts matching your specified keywords.  
When a match is found, you'll receive a **desktop notification instantly**‚Äîso you never miss a great deal again.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîç Monitors both Marketplace and private group posts
- üõéÔ∏è Sends real-time **MacBook notifications** for matched keywords
- üìù Logs matched results into a `matched_posts.txt` file for easy reference

If you're searching for specific items but don‚Äôt have time to watch Facebook all day, this tool is for you.
